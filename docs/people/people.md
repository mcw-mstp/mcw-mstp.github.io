| Name | Email | Background |
|---|---|---|
| Stephen | smazurchuk@mcw.edu | I work mainly with fMRI datasets (imaging data) and have a strong background in Python and Matlab. <br>Also somewhat knowledgeable in some machine learning topics |
| Moujtaba | mkasmani@mcw.edu | My work is centered around using sequencing techniques such as bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, and scTCR-seq to study the immune system. Most of my work is done in R, although I occasionally use some tools directly in the Linux terminal/command line. |
| Shana | ssnarrenberg@mcw.edu | |
| Peter | pezhang@mcw.edu | My background is in Statistics and I work primarily in R. I also have some knowledge in C++ and some maching learning topics |
| Kyler | kscrawford@mcw.edu | I am a structural biologist using techniques like NMR to study cancer signaling proteins. My research relies on protein visualization and modeling using applications like Pymol and Rosetta.
| Ryan | rbonate@mcw.edu | My background is in biophysics and mathematics. My research is in structural MRI and relies mainly on image analysis. |
| Megan | mcfischer@mcw.edu | My background is in genetics and genomics. My research involves the analysis of WES and WGS data for variant/gene discovery in ocular developmental disorders. |
| Mindy | minkim@mcw.edu | I have little to no experience with coding. I have worked with STATA in the past for statistical analyses. |
| Emma | etillison@mcw.edu | |
| Joe | jhennessey@mcw.edu | I don't know much about coding, please don't reach out to me |
| Andrew | acao@mcw.edu | I have done half of the R tutorial |
| Malone |mfriedman@mcw.edu||
| Katie | ktaquet@mcw.edu | |
