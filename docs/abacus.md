# Association for Biomolecular and Computational Simulation

<div align="center" ><em>A student-run coding group for everyone</em></div> 

Welcome! ABACUS is an open group for coding and learning to use new applications. We have meetings that cover the basics of coding (like shaping and tidying data) along with more complex topics.

ABACUS will be meeting this Fall on **Thursdays at 4pm** in MEB2050/2070 (grad school classroom). There will also be python focus group meetings Thursdays from 5-5:30 with William Yuan (and others)

Interact with us anytime on the ABACUS slack channel or shoot us an email just to say hi :wave: or to be added to the Abacus email list!
