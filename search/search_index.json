There are two main ways. Both methods require a github account, so if you do not already have one, go ahead and make one. To begin, we strongly reccoment adding your name under the 'People' tab as a way to familiarize yourself with the process. Quick and Easy On a page that you would like to edit, simply click the ' ' icon at the heading you would like to edit. This will take you to a page where you can make an edit mark at the title. After having made your change to the .md file, don't hesitate to be verbose in describing the change you made. Once you submit the change as a pull-request, the change will be reviewed and then (likely) committed to the website. Thats it! Longer (but more versatile way) For larger changes, it will likely be easier to actually get used to using github 1) Install git If it's not already installed on your system, the first step is to install the git utility. This is what underlies github.com and most collaborative projects across the web. Follow the instructions at the below link to get started https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git Note Make sure to make a github account so that you can push changes to public repositories 2) Clone this Repository On your system, open up a folder and change the directory ( cd command) to wherever you would like this repository to be saved. Then clone this repository and cd into the directory! cd /home/smazurchuk/Desktop # or whatever folder you prefer git clone https://github.com/mcw-mstp/mcw-mstp.github.io.git cd mcw-mstp.github.io 3) Create a New Working Branch We now have to create a new banch. You can pick whatever name you like for this, and create the branch with the command git checkout -b branch-name-here The -b option indicates that you are creating a new branch. 4) Install mkdocs (Optional) Info Installing this is only necessary to preview changes In order to generate a live preview of the edits you make to the site, you will need to download a python package called mkdocs. If python or a way of managing python virtual environments is not already installed on your system, there is better documentation elsewhere for doing those steps. If you have python installed, then simply type: pip install mkdocs To see if all the required packages installed, try to serve the webpage mkdocs serve If there is an error, there might be some extenstions missing. In this case, try the following command pip install mkdocs-material-extensions If not, shoot me an email 5) Make an edit! We suggest that the first edit is adding your name to the contributers page! To do this, open the file people.md file in the docs folder in your favorite text editor . Then add your name using | as a dividers between table values. | Name | Email | Background | |---|---|---| | Stephen | smazurchuk@mcw.edu | I work mainly with fMRI datasets (imagingn data) and have a strong background in python and Matlab. <br>Also somewhat knowledgeable in some machine learning topics | |Dohn Joe | dj@mcw.edu | A made-up personality | Note If you would like for the text in the background section to be broken up over multiple lines, make sure to include the <br> text where you would like a line break 6) Push Changes to Github This section will perhaps have the strangest instructions for those new to git . Now that you have edited and saved your changes to people.md . The steps are: git add docs/people.md git commit -m \"your message here in qoutes\" git push origin branch-name-here 7) Make Pull Request for Official Site Finally, this last step submits your changes for review before it is merged with the main branch. To this, you can go to github.com and when you go to this repository, you should see the ability to click a green button that says \"Compare & Pull Request\". Follow the steps, and write a description of what your pull request changes on the site. This info will be reviewed and then merged with the site! That's it! Extra Info Mkdocs is a very convienent tool for building documentation. For working with this site, the only commands you should need are: mkdocs serve - Start the live-reloading docs server. mkdocs gh-deploy --force - Build the documentation site. (This pushes the built site to the gh-pages branch). The force option is needed since we hace multiple pages under some of the main headers mkdocs -h - Print help message and exit.

It starts by going over the basics of scRNA-seq and how it differs from bulk RNA-seq. We'll then download a publicly available dataset and analyze it together using the attached script. Feel free to look at or download the slides below! This is an embedded Microsoft Office presentation, powered by Office .

Code can only be written in chunks, which are set off by sets of three tick marks (```). Spaces between chunks can be used to take notes. To add a new chunk, click the \u201cInsert\u201d icon towards the top right of the script section of RStudio. Then select \u201cR\u201d from the dropdown menu. Alternatively, press Command + Option + I (Mac) or Control + Alt + I (Windows) on your keyboard. You can name chunks by typing a name after the letter \u201cr\u201d inside the curly braces. The drop down menu in the bottom left of the script section of RStudio allows you to skip to any chunk, so naming chunks makes it easy to keep track of where you want to skip to in your script. # Inside a chunk, anything in a line written after a pound sign/hashtag is a comment and will not be run as code # Use comments to take notes in line with your code install.packages ( \"Seurat\" ) install.packages ( \"tidyverse\" ) # Downloaded packages are not automatically available for use in R # The library() function loads packages for use in one session of R # If you restart R, you don't need to install the packages again, but you do need to library() them library ( Seurat ) ##
